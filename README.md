# PHPCheckDigitValidator
A small PHP webpage that validates whether a sequence of numbers (UPC, ISBN) has a valid check digit.
This project was created for a group presentation in my Discrete Math class. My group was assigned to present check digits in class and I thought it would be fun to write a small program to validate check digits. Since I was working with PHP at the time I decided to write it in PHP.
